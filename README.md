The website's layout will change based on user's display screen size.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge I learnt to implement responsive web design principles to build a webpage.
I learnt how and when to use media query and also how to create responsive images and used responsive units like rem, em and %
instead of using pixels.

### Continued development

I aim at perfecting my coding style and will try to implement Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) method to write less code and do more.
I also aim at further improving my CSS skills and learn new CSS frameworks for a better mobile-first approach for other challenges.
